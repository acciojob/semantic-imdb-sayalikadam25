		<p>Enola Holmes 2 is a 2022 mystery film and the sequel to the 2020 film Enola Holmes, both of which star Millie Bobby Brown as the title character, the teenage sister of the already-famous Victorian-era detective Sherlock Holmes. The film is directed by Harry Bradbeer from a screenplay by Jack Thorne that adapts the book series The Enola Holmes Mysteries by Nancy Springer. Unlike its predecessor, the film does not adapt one of Springer's novels and instead takes real-life inspiration from the 1888 matchgirls' strike.[2] In addition to Brown, Henry Cavill, Louis Partridge, Susie Wokoma, Adeel Akhtar, and Helena Bonham Carter reprise their supporting roles, while David Thewlis and Sharon Duncan-Brewster join the cast.

Filming began in Autumn 2021 and ended in January 2022. Enola Holmes 2 was released on November 4, 2022, by Netflix. The film received positive reviews from critics and topped Netflix's viewership charts in 93 countries.</p>
